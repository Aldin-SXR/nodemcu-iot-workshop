# NodeMCU Workshop

## Setup

### VSCode
__Visual Studio Code__ is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux.

It comes with support for a number of programming languages (C/C++ included), and is easy to set up and customize with extensions.

In this workshop, we will use VSCode instead of the "standard" choice of Arduino IDE, as it offers a great extension PlatformIO (which will handle all our NodeMCU library setup and installation needs).

You can install VSCode by downloading the appropriate version for your system from [https://code.visualstudio.com/](the official link).
